# FinOps Definition 

FinOps ensures you get the most value out of every dollar spent in cloud. FinOps enables a shift — a combination of systems, best practices and culture — to increase an organization’s ability to understand cloud costs and make business tradeoffs. In the same way that DevOps revolutionized development by breaking down silos and increasing agility, FinOps increases the business value of cloud by bringing together technology, business and finance professionals with a new set of processes.
